devices (“tags”). First, the architecture and design of a software-defined passive
tag called WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform) is discussed in detail. Several
implemented applications including neural sensing and strain measurement are also
reviewed. Second, a passive data logger (“PDL”) is presented, which employs a novel
wirelessly-charged power model. Third, design and results of a fully-integrated system-onchip
(“SoC”) sensor tag are presented. All of the work is compatible with EPC Class 1
Generation 2 protocol, allowing use with industry-standard UHF RFID readers.},

During the last half of 1960, we derived a detailed theoretical rationale for a radio frequency system involving inductive coupling between a thin, small, pancake-shaped coil on the surface of the chest and a similar coil either within the chest or, alternatively, subcutaneously. Having an efficiency of about 95%, the system was evaluated in dogs at 50 and 69 W levels, respectively. Thus was born what is now termed the transcutaneous energy transformer (TET).},
